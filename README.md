Patch is the result of me being bored and wanting to play around with a different API.

Note that this uses Twilio, FLASK and ngrok on a web server to run.

I definitely did not set this up alone, JÃ³zsef Sallai (@jozsefsallai) was a massive help and I would have never figured out the web server without him!
